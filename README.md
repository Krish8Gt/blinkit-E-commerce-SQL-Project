## Project Instructions: SQL Analysis on a Schema 

### Objective

The objective of this project is to perform SQL queries on a schema, demonstrating your understanding of SQL concepts and data analysis techniques. You will write and execute queries to extract meaningful insights from the data and present your findings.

### Steps and Guidelines
**1.	Set Up Your Environment**

Ensure you have access to a SQL database (MySQL).

Download and set up a schema. 

**2.	Project Setup**

Create a new directory for your project.

Use a SQL script for your analysis.

Create a README file that briefly describes the dataset and the steps you plan to take in your analysis.

**3.	Data Import and Schema Overview**

Import the data into your SQL database.

Provide an overview of the schema with ER diagram.

Use DESCRIBE or SHOW COLUMNS commands to understand the structure of each table.

**4.	Data Analysis Using SQL**

**Descriptive Statistics:**

Write queries to calculate basic statistics such as count, sum, average, minimum, and maximum for numerical columns.

Example: Calculate the total sales, average order value, and total number of transactions.

Data Cleaning:

Write queries to identify and handle missing or inconsistent data.

Example: Find rows with NULL values in important columns and decide how to handle them (e.g., filling, removing).

**Aggregation and Grouping:**

Use GROUP BY to aggregate data by different dimensions.

Example: Calculate total sales by product category, region, or time period.

**Joins and Relationships:**

Write queries to join tables to extract meaningful insights.

Example: Join the sales with the product table to get product names and categories.

**Subqueries and CTEs:**

Use subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to write complex queries.

Example: Use a CTE to calculate the monthly sales and then find the month with the highest sales.
